# Testcase Example:  '[100,4,200,1,3,2]'
#
# Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest
# consecutive elements sequence.
# 
# You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
# Output: 4
# Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].
# Therefore its length is 4.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
# Output: 9
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
# -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
# 
#

                while num + len in sets : 
                    len  +=1
                maxlen = max(len,maxlen)
        return maxlen
